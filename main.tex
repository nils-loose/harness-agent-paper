\begin{abstract}
Coverage-guided fuzzing effectively discovers vulnerabilities in software systems, but applying it to library code requires specialized fuzz harnesses that bridge fuzzer-generated inputs to API invocations. Manual harness creation is time-consuming and expertise-intensive, requiring deep understanding of API semantics, initialization sequences, and exception handling contracts.
We present a multi-agent architecture that automates fuzz harness generation for Java libraries through specialized LLM-powered agents. Five ReAct agents decompose the workflow into research, synthesis, compilation repair, coverage analysis, and refinement. Rather than preprocessing entire codebases, agents query documentation, source code, and callgraph information on demand through the Model Context Protocol, maintaining focused context while exploring complex dependencies.
To enable effective refinement, we introduce method-targeted coverage that tracks coverage only during target method execution to isolate target behavior, and agent-guided termination that examines uncovered source code to distinguish productive refinement opportunities from diminishing returns.
We evaluated our approach on seven target methods from six widely-deployed Java libraries totaling 115,000+ Maven dependents. Our generated harnesses achieve a median improvement of 26\% in method-targeted coverage over manually-written OSS-Fuzz baselines and outperform both OSS-Fuzz and Jazzer AutoFuzz by 6\% and 5\% respectively under full package-scope coverage. Generation costs average \$3.20 and 10 minutes per harness, making the approach practical for continuous fuzzing workflows. During 12-hour fuzzing campaigns, our harnesses discovered 3 unreported bugs in methods that are already integrated into OSS-Fuzz, demonstrating that automated generation achieves sufficient quality for real bug discovery.

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

We presented a multi-agent architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with code analysis to fully automate fuzzing harness generation for Java libraries. By combining query-driven information retrieval through the Model Context Protocol with method-targeted coverage instrumentation and agent-guided termination, our approach achieves competitive coverage with manually-written OSS-Fuzz baselines while discovering real vulnerabilities in production libraries. With generation costs averaging \$3.20 and approximately 10 minutes per harness, the approach demonstrates practical feasibility for integration into continuous fuzzing workflows.
