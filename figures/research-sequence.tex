\caption{Sequence diagram showing initial tool interactions during the research phase for \texttt{Jsoup.parse(String)}. The researcher agent iteratively queries Javadoc MCP (for API documentation) and CodeContext MCP (for source code) to understand the target method's invocation requirements. Solid arrows represent tool calls; dashed arrows represent responses.}
